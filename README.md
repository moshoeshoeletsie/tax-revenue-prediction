# tax-revenue-prediction
In this project, we develop a machine learning model to predict
tax revenue based on historical data.
Steps in the Project
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
We start by loading the dataset from a CSV file and dropping columns with no data.
Missing values in numerical columns are imputed using the median of each column.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To understand the distribution and relationships in our data, we:

-Plot boxplots to identify outliers in numerical columns.

-Calculate z-scores to detect and remove outliers.

-Generate descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.

-One-hot encode categorical variables.

-Visualize correlations between features using a heatmap.

-Plot histograms to understand the distribution of numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering
We separate the features from the target variable
(assumed to be 'Value' for tax revenue prediction)
and scale the features using StandardScaler.

5. Model Training
We split the data into training and testing sets and train a LinearRegression model.
The model is then evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.

7. Visualization of Model Performance
We create scatter plots to visualize the model's
predictions against the actual values.

9. Model Tuning
We tune a Ridge regression model using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
The tuned model is then evaluated and compared with the initial model.

10. Saving the Model
Finally, we save the trained model and the scaler to disk using the pickle library.
